# Book Tracker/Library

### Description
Some practice using a form to capture user data, and then capturing that user data using objects/dictionaries. It's also Nathan For You themed, because I'm a huge Nathan For You fan.

## Instructions 
- Navigate to https://paigethompson150.github.io/library/
- Click on the 'Add a New Book' button 
- Insert information about book title, author, and date published. 
- Click on the button on your new book to change its color, or the trash can to delete it!
